This readme is meant to tell you how to add your custom sentences that the game can be played with.

1. Open the file sentences.txt (it has to be named that way) - it is just a basic .txt file, you can open it with whatever text editor you want.
2. Write a sentence with _____, also called "free space", many times in the sentence you want, but keep in mind that the sentence has not to have any newlines ("\n"), so just dont use enters, except of that the word can be any size you want, as long as i am concerned that open() has no line-length limitations.
3. Right before the sentence insert the number of _____ "free spaces" you have put into your sentence, like this: "1To be or not to ____.".
4. Make sure that your sentence ends with a symbol other than "_" like "." or "?".
5. The game can be played with one sentence only!!! So dont put any more than that. (I might remove this limitation in the future)

Your sentence has to look like this:
"5I am ____ who is also _____ which means that ____ ____ and _____!"
